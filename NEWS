libgwyfile-1.6 (2023-04-24)
- Fixed mishandling of GwyLawn "segments" data which should contain twice as
  many integers than gwyfile 1.5 expected.

libgwyfile-1.5 (2022-02-11)
- New functions for GwyLawn curve map data type.
- New functions for GwySelectionProjective selection type.
- New flag for checking Gwyddion-specific data objects.
- Examples using gwyfile to send messages over network were improved to handle
  various failures in realistic situations better.
- Fixed gwyfile_object_container_enumerate_xyz() trying to access Surfaces as
  DataFields.

libgwyfile-1.4 (2020-06-08)
- New functions for item and object copying.
- A simple example using gwyfile to send messages over network was added.
- A specific error code for truncated buffers was added.
- The Win32 library symbol file gwyfile.def was actually updated.
- Declaration of function gwyfile_object_data_size() was restored.
- Vim syntax file was added.

libgwyfile-1.3 (2020-06-02)
- New functions for reading from and writing to memory buffers.
- New functions for GwySelectionCross selection type.
- New function for accessing n-th item of an object.
- Win32 compilation error in gwyfile_set_error_errno() was fixed.
- Byte swapping when writing files was fixed for big endian machines.
- Documentation build on Debian was fixed.

libgwyfile-1.2 (2016-04-27)
- New functions for handling GwySurface and GwySelectionPath data objects were
  added.
- New function for enumeration of XYZ data in Gwyddion files was added.
- Example program readgwy.c was updated to include the new data types.
- Installing the library (as opposed to embedding it) works meaningfully, i.e.
  it actually installs the library files and headers now.  A pkg-config file
  is also installed now.

libgwyfile-1.1 (2016-01-12)
- gwyfile_item_get_int64() and gwyfile_item_new_internal_int64() were fixed
  to actually work with 64bit values, not just 32bit.
- New function gwyfile_check_object() can check for violation of the GWY file
  format specifications that are not physically enforced during normal
  libgwyfile usage, and for things that are not violations but should be
  avoided anyway.
- New struct GwyfileErrorList was added for gwyfile_check_object() reports.
- A few error messages are more specific or detailed now.
- New example, checkgeneric, was added as a simple demonstration of the
  checking functions.
- Running tests under valgrind can be disabled by --without-valgrind configure
  option.

libgwyfile-1.0 (2015-07-13)
- Special item names for data ownership taking (ending with "(take)") now
  actually work instead of returning NULL.
- GwyDataLine data extractor was fixed to extract "res", not "xres".
- GwySelectionAxis constructor actually returns GwySelectionAxis now, not
  GwySelectionLattice.
- Non-standard use of va_arg() was fixed, making convenience constructors and
  extractors work when compiled with MSVC.
- The maximum object/item nesting depth has been limited to 200 in file reading
  to avoid stack overflows.
- It is safe to call gwyfile_error_clear() with the pointer to an unset error.
- New functions gwyfile_write_wfile() and gwyfile_read_wfile() were added for
  Win32 to permit using wide-character file names.
- A workaround for broken vsnprintf() on Win32 was added to error reporting so
  detailed errors have now meaningful domains, codes and messages on Win32.
- Examples were tweaked to compile on Win32 cleanly.
- Misdetection of Win32 environment by configure was fixed.
- A gwyfile.def listing exported symbols was added to the distribution for
  Win32 compilation.
- MSVC 2015 project files were added to the distribution in the msvc2015
  subdirectory.
- Examples are linked as static.

libgwyfile-0.9 (2015-03-31)
- Many more functions for construction of Gwyddion data objects.
- The special item names specifying memory handling have changed from e.g.
  "data-copy" to "data(copy)".  And they actually work now.
- New functions for extracting information from Gwyddion data objects:
  gwyfile_object_datafield_get(), gwyfile_object_dataline_get(), etc.
- New high-level functions for enumeration of channels, volume data, etc. in
  Gwyddion files.
- New functions for obtaining the number of items in an object and the list of
  their names.
- Construction of item lists, either using gwyfile_object_newv() or when
  reading files, is no longer quadratic-time on the number of items.
- Array setter functions correctly update the array length to the new length.
- gwyfile_item_release_object() unsets the object owner as it should.
- A confinement error is reported when the end of file is hit unexpectedly in
  otherwise valid data (previous version reported a system error with zero
  errno).
- gwyfile_fread() actually uses the max_size argument to constrain the size
  of the top-level object.
- gwyfile_read_file() determines the file size first for improved overrun
  checks.
- Miscellaneous documentation improvements.

libgwyfile-0.8 (2014-12-14)
- First public release.
